# random-password-generator

A simple random password generator written in python using tkinter.

What the project does? Generates a random password of fixed length and strength (weak, good, strong) as determined by the user. Length is fixed between 8 and 16 because the former is the usual standard minimum when creating passwords while the latter seems like a reasonable maximum. The user can create an account name that the generated password is for and save them to a file.

Weak strength generates a password using capital and lower case letters. Good strength generates a password using letters (capital/ lowercase) and digits (0-9). Strong generates a password using letters, digits and punctuation.
